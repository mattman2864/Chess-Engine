# Chess-Engine
This is a project I've been working on for a few weeks, and have had many restarts/reworks.

### Current Version:
- Pseudo-Random moves
- undo/redo moves
- moves list on side of screen
- clean UI + resizeable window
- Checks
- En Passant
- Promotion

### TODO:
- Checkmate
- Stalemate
- Castling
- UI For user choice on promotion
